# Selenium 4 - Python examples

Selenium is a toolkit for interacting with web pages, it can operate with the browser open or with the browser hidden (headless mode). Selenium is commonly used for automating user acceptance testing (UAT); these tests can be created visually using the browser plugin (Selenium IDE) or programmatically using Selenium with the WebDriver API (supported languages only).
